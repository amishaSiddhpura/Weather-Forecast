Weather-Forecast
=======================

Weather forecasting is the prediction of the state of the atmosphere for a given location using the application of science and technology. This includes perature, rain, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. Weather warnings are a special kind of short-range forecast carried out for the protection of human life. The aim of the project is to forecast weather for 7 or 15 days and user can easily know about the weather earlier. I have designed the application in such a way that user can easily understand about the weather of different cities. This application gathers data from public Api OpenWeatherMap api key .It's a quick, simple weather app that includes forecasts, current temperature, hourly forecasts, and more.
